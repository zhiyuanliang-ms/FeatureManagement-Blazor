The objectives of this project are: 
1. To explain the reason why people might prefer to use the open-source dependency injection framework, such as AutoFac, instead of `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` (MEDI).
2. To demonstrate how to use Microsoft.FeatureManagement with other dependency injection framework.
